/*
Business Purpose:
This model creates the customer dimension for analytics, enabling filtering by segment and tier and joining customer metadata to fact tables like tickets and notes.

3NF Construct:
- Selects only atomic customer attributes with no repeating groups or transitive dependencies.
- All non-key columns depend solely on the primary key, customer_id.

Transformations:
- Directly sources from raw.CRM_CUSTOMERS.
- Standardizes casing by lowercasing column names.
- Excludes optional or high‚Äênull columns (e.g., middle_name, address) to reduce sparsity.
