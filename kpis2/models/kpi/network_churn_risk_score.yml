      Network-Driven Churn Risk Score (NCRS) - Predicts customer churn risk based on network performance issues.
      
      This KPI combines multiple network-related factors to create a composite risk score (0-100):
      - Network incidents affecting customer (40% weight)
      - Support tickets related to network issues (30% weight) 
      - Usage pattern changes indicating dissatisfaction (20% weight)
      - Service quality metrics like peak overload incidents (10% weight)
      
      Business Value:
      - Enables proactive retention before customers decide to leave
      - Identifies network infrastructure issues impacting customer satisfaction
      - Provides early warning system 30-60 days before traditional churn indicators
      - Helps prioritize network investments based on customer impact
